    "## Default Parameters of the agent\n",
    "The parameters that the agent will use unless they are defined otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maze Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **mazeType** = defines the maze that the agent moves in -> can be defined in the getWalls() function\n",
    "\n",
    "- **stateType** = defines the \"shape\" of the feature that is TD (Temporal difference) learned on -> that feature can be Gaussian, onehot (same magnitude within, zero outside), gaussianCS (no clue), circles, bump (also no clue) -> in initialise it also defines a \"fourier\" option\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Movement Policy** = defines the movement policy of the agent -> what that policy looks like, what options there are and how it is updated at each time step dt is further define din the function movementPolicyUpdate()\n",
    "\n",
    "- **roomSize** = a parameter that defines the size of the respective maze that was set in mazeType\n",
    "\n",
    "- **dt** = is the simulation time step -> discretises continuous time and determines how often certain other variables are updated. Default is \"None\" bcs that way it chooses the largest time step that is safe to use -> keep a balance between computational power needed and model precision\n",
    "\n",
    "- **dx** = discretises space -> steps the agent makes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **speedScale** = defines the movement speed of the agent -> meters /sec\n",
    "\n",
    "- **rotSpeedScale** = how much the agent rotates per second -> radians/sec\n",
    "\n",
    "- **initPos** = initial position of the agent when the agent is initialised, not at the start of every trial -> e.g. if you initialise a new agent at every trial, this initial position is used, but if you use the same agent for every trial, only the first will have the initial position\n",
    "\n",
    "- **initDir** = initial direction of the agent in which the agent moves -> same as for initPos\n",
    "\n",
    "- **nCells** = how many features to use -> *Question:* basis features or successor features? => probably basis tho\n",
    "\n",
    "- **centres** = this is an array of the positions of teh receptive fields -> this overwrites nCells -> probably if there are more or less cells in \"centres\" than in \"nCells\" => \"centres\" basically has the final word\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sigma** = controls the width of the place fields of the basis features -> each cell has receptive field centred somehwere in the maze and sigma defines the width of that field: small sigma = narrow place field; large sigma = wide place field => kinda depends on the stateType tho and is for example irrelevant for onehot place cells. For Guassian cells sigma effectively controls the width of the curve, while for onehot, the size depends on nCells (this needs to be double checked tho!!)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **doorsClosed** = whether the doors are open or closed in a multicompartment maze -> in the case of George study, this probably applied to the 2-room maze (*Note to self: Might be interesting to look at if we reach DNMTP situation with project -> i.e. can we make a if condition or sth to determine whether an arm is open or not*)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **reorderCells** = whether or not to reorder the cells that were defined in \"centres\" or \"nCells\". This doesn't change the actual ordering/placing of cells in the maze but just the way in which they are indexed -> i.e. indexed fom left to right in 1D or in columns/rows in 2D\n",
    "\n",
    "- **firingRateLookUp** = when true, the model uses a table of precomputed firing rates to get the firing rates of the basis features and doesn't need to compute the firing rates every time form the tuning curve of the place fields -> less computationally demanding (*Note: would be interesting to know how x is discretised in the table*)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **biasDoorCross** = whether the bias to cross the door is \"ON\" or \"OFF\" -> relevant for 2-room maze in George et al. (2023) study\n",
    "\n",
    "- **biasWallFollow** = whether the bias to follow walls (thigmotaxis) is \"ON\" or \"OFF\" -> relvant for 2-room maze \n",
    "\n",
    "### TD Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **tau** = the TD decay time -> determines the predictive time horizon of the SR and is in that sense sort of analogous to the discount factor in discrete-time TD learning. large tau -> long predictive time horizon; small tau -> short predictive time horizon\n",
    "- **TDdx** = controls when in space TD updates happen -> so the distance between TD learning updates in meters\n",
    "- **alpha** = the learning rate (as in usual RL TD learning) -> controls convergence speed of successor features -> larger alpha => faster convergence bcs faster learning\n",
    "- **successorFeatureNorm** = a scaling constant that rescales the magnitude of the SR : *M ← Norm × M* Apparently used to improve numerical stabiloity of the SR and to keep TD and STDP SRs comprable\n",
    "- **TDreg** = adds a weight decay apparently to make sure the weights don't grow too large and helps prevent divergence with long simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "### STDP Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **peakFiringRate** = peak firing rate of place cell at center of place field if preferred phase is at centre of field\n",
    "- **tau_STDP_plus** = the pre trace decay time -> time constant of the pre-before-post potentiation window -> how long a pre synaptic spike leaves a trace\n",
    "- **tau_STDP_minus** = post trace decay time -> how long a post spike influences LTD -> basically the post-before-pre depression window\n",
    "- **a_STDP** = pre-before-post potentiation factor (post-before-pre = 1) -> the relative strngth of potetiation vs depression\n",
    "- **eta** = the STDP learning rate (equivalent to alpha in TD) -> higher eta = faster weight change; lower eta = slower convergence\n",
    "- **baseLineFiringRate** = a constant firing rate that is added everywhere -> usually set to 0 (default) to isolate spatially selective firing in changing weights\n",
    "- **use_full_STDP_rule** = whether or not to use full STDP rule or a simplified version (*Note: what is the simplified version tho?*)\n",
    "- **online_mapping** = determines how to map CA3 -> CA1 during learning -> \"identity\" means that CA1 initiall mirrors CA3 and then STDP modifieds this towards the successor representation\n",
    "- **rownorm** = normalises outgoing weights from each neuron -> without pure STDP learning (according to ChatGPT, so needs to be double-checked!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase Precession Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **thetaFreq** = determines oscillation frequency\n",
    "- **precessFraction** = Fraction of 2π through which preferred firing phase shifts across a place field -> 0.5 means it shifts through half a theta cycle => sort of controls the strength of the phase precession -> if higher -> stronger ordering inside a single traversal\n",
    "- **kappa** = The von Mises spread parameter -> determines the phase tuning sharpness, i.e. hogh tightly the firing of spikes is locked to their preferred phase => if kappa larger -> stronger sequential compression (*Note: maybe sth to look at if we change theta frequency, where we then also need tighter phase locking*)\n"
